# NOTICE: This code is based on nanite-admin from the EY nanite project.

# To work without being installed as a gem:

# IMPORTANT!
# You need raggi's patched async version of Thin at the moment to use
# the nanite-admin tool.
#
# raggi's Git repo contains a branch called 'async_for_rack' which contains the
# version of Thin you want to install. raggi has apparently removed the 'master'
# branch of his Git repo so you may see a warning like that shown below.
